Builtin schemas
###############

Here is the list of configuration schemas implemented as part of
`django-confit`. They are schemas that will automatically be loaded.

* `Django`_ is supported
* `django-debug-toolbar`_
* `django-nose`_
* `django-pimpmytheme`_
* `django-pipeline`_
* `raven`_

.. note::

   Maintaining schemas for third-party applications is hard! Any help would be
   welcome, as an example:

   * report bugs ;
   * improve existing schemas (smarter validation) ;
   * watch upgrades, support several versions.

   If you are a library developer and you like `django-confit`, the best thing
   you can do is to distribute your app's schema inside your app! So that
   you maintain the schema along with your application, and `django-confit`
   does not have to deal with multiple versions (given a version of your app,
   there is only one valid schema for your app, and it lives within your app).
